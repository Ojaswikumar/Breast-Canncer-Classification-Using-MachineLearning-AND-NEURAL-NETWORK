# Breast Cancer Classification


## Breast Cancer ( 1 = Malignant(M) vs 0 = Benign(B) ) 
### Breast cancer dataset 
This dataset consists of 10 features whose values are obtained in terms of Mean, Standard error and worst case.
First two columns gives us the information about ID and The output itself (Malignant or Benign).

*Instruction for data-preprocessing*
- First load the data.csv file to dataframe.
- Then divide it to test and train dataset in 80:20.
- Normalize the data i.e. feature normalization.


This repository contains the implementation of various machine learning models to classify breast cancer based on ten real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus. The features include:

1. **Radius:** Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
2. **Texture:** Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
3. **Perimeter:** Perimeter of the cell nucleus.
4. **Area:** Area of the cell nucleus.
5. **Smoothness:** Local variation in radius lengths.
6. **Compactness:** (Perimeter^2 / Area) - 1.0.
7. **Concavity:** Severity of concave portions of the contour.
8. **Concave Points:** Number of concave portions of the contour.
9. **Symmetry:** Symmetry of the cell nucleus.
10. **Fractal Dimension:** "Coastline approximation" - 1.
